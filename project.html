      <h1>IFHE ANTIRAGGINNG CELL<h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In view of the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in SLP No. 24295 of 2006 dated 16-05-2007 and in Civil Appeal number 887 of 2009, dated 08-05-2009 to prohibit, prevent and eliminate the scourge of ragging including any conduct by any student or students.
        <br>IFHE University, Hyderabad is part of the ICFAI Group, known for its Quality of Education and Professional Ethics. With its Pan-India presence - 11 Universities, 9 B-Schools,7 Tech-Schools, 5 Law-schools and 3 Decades in Flexible Learning- it has been pioneering Professional Education in India for over 30 years.
      We have a dedicated Anti Ragging cell to take care of issues regarding any ragging acts</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">While the students as adult citizens of the country enjoy their rights, they also are expected to be aware of their responsibilities. The institute will not support any act that is illegal as construed by the law of the land. As adults, the students are expected to have a fair sense of which act is legal and what is illegal. They should conduct themselves both inside and outside the institute in a manner that is befitting an institute of this stature. In addition to being mature and responsible in conduct, the students are expected to respect the rights of the other students of IBS community. The Institute encourages an all round development of students’ personality and their progressive and creative thinking. At the same time, in order that they effectively discharge civic responsibilities and virtues, the institute sets it’s own terms of conduct that must be adhered to by the students.</p>
